# Text-Generation-Ngram-Model

This repository contains an implementation of an N-Gram Language Model for predicting the next word in a sequence of words. The model is built using Python and is capable of generating text predictions based on input sentences.

## Introduction

An N-Gram Language Model is a type of probabilistic language model that predicts the next word in a sequence of words based on the context of the preceding words. This repository contains a Python implementation of an N-Gram Language Model that utilizes a given corpus to build the model and generate text predictions.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Ngram_Text_Prediction.py file to access the Python class implementation.
3. Run the Python script and provide input sentences to predict the next word.
